# Django CSRF Verification Failed

If you are seeing a "CSRF verification failed" error in your Django application, it means that the CSRF token sent with a POST request does not match the token stored in the server's session.

To fix this error, you can try the following solutions:

1. Make sure that your HTML form includes the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag inside the `<form>` element. This will generate a hidden input field with the CSRF token value.

2. If you are using AJAX to submit your form, make sure to include the CSRF token in your AJAX request. You can get the CSRF token value from the `csrfmiddlewaretoken` cookie. Here's an example:

```
var csrftoken = Cookies.get('csrftoken');
$.ajax({
type: 'POST',
url: '/my-url/',
data: {
'mydata': mydata,
'csrfmiddlewaretoken': csrftoken
},
success: function(response) {
// Handle the response
}
});
```

3. If you are still getting the error, make sure that the `csrfmiddlewaretoken` cookie is being sent with the POST request. You can check this in your browser's developer console.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to review your Django application's CSRF protection settings. Check that the `MIDDLEWARE` setting includes the `'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware'` middleware class and that the `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` setting is set to `True` if your application is served over HTTPS.

If you are still having trouble, consider posting a question on a forum or Q&A site dedicated to Django, or consult the Django documentation for more information.
