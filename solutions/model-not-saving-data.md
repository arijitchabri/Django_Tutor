## Issue: Django models not showing data

### Problem Description

I have a Django project where I define several models, but when I try to display the data in my templates, nothing shows up. I have checked the database, and the data is definitely there, but for some reason it is not being displayed.

### Steps Taken

I have tried the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Checked that the models are correctly defined and that there are no errors in the code.
- Checked that the database is properly configured and that the models are being saved to the database.
- Checked that the views are properly defined and that they are correctly passing the data to the templates.

### Possible Solution

After some research, I found out that this issue can sometimes be caused by using a different database for development and production, and not properly syncing the two. To solve this issue, I ran the following command:

``` 
python manage.py migrate --database=default
```

This synced the database for the default database settings, and the models started displaying data properly in the templates.

### Conclusion

If you are facing a similar issue with Django models not showing data, make sure to check that your database is properly synced and that you are using the correct database settings for your environment.
